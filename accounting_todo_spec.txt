Create the UI


1. Display the CoA tree 
	=> You can edit, create, or delete 
	=> Display the first 2 depth 
	
	=> Create the initial migration ( call to the server )
	
	
2. Create TransactionActivity (hbox) => middle == the transaction-activity_list
																				right == the details 
																				
																				
That's it. 


3. execute_salvage_booking  << HTTP post from the UI  (indicate the salvage on the ListView)
